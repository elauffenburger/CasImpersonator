# Java Readme
## Requirements:

You'll need to know how to use the following to build the Java flavor:
- Maven
- IDE of some kind (I prefer Eclipse)
- A maven interface for your IDE (m2e works great)

## How to Build:
I'm only going to include how to do this in Eclipse, as that is my preferred IDE:

1. Install m2e
2. File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Project
3. Find your clone of CasImpersonator/cas-impersonator
4. Follow the bouncing thumb!

You can really do this from scratch if you want (just check the dependencies in the pom)
